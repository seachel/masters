\chapter{Overview}

The goal of this research is to increase the reasoning abilities of an existing system that is intended to help mechanize programming language metatheory. This system is called Hybrid and is part of the research program carried out by the Software Correctness and Safety Research Laboratory at the University of Ottawa under the supervision of Professor Amy Felty. Hybrid uses the technique of higher-order abstract syntax and an intermediate reasoning layer to make the proofs of programming language theorems more efficient.
