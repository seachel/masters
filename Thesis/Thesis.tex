Hybrid is a two-level logical framework that supports higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), where a specification logic (SL) extends the class of object logics (OLs) we can reason about. We develop a new Hybrid SL and formalize its metatheory, proving weakening, contraction, exchange, and cut admissibility; results that greatly simplify reasoning about OLs in systems providing HOAS. The SL is a sequent calculus defined as an inductive type in Coq and we prove properties by structural induction over SL sequents. We also present a generalized SL and metatheory statement, allowing us to prove many cases of such theorems in a general way and understand how to identify and prove the difficult cases. We make a concrete and measurable improvement to Hybrid with the new SL formalization and provide a technique for abstracting such proofs, leading to a condensed presentation, greater understanding, and a generalization that may be instantiated to other logics.


%1. Introduction. In one sentence, what's the topic? 47
%Hybrid is a two-level logical framework supporting higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS), where a specification logic (SL) extends the class of object logics (OLs) that we can reason about.
%Hybrid is a logical framework supporting higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) in representing formal systems or ``object logics'' (OLs) and implemented following a two-level approach, where a specification logic (SL) extends the class of OLs that we can reason about.
%2. State the problem you tackle. 34
%We develop a new Hybrid SL and formalize its metatheory, proving weakening, contraction, exchange, and cut admissibility; results that greatly simplify reasoning about OLs in systems providing HOAS.
%3. Summarize (in one sentence) why nobody else has adequately answered the research question yet.
%Hybrid is the only known two-level logical framework supporting HOAS implemented in an existing general-purpose theorem prover.
%...so although related systems....?
%5. In one sentence, how did you go about doing the research that follows from your big idea?
%The SL is a sequent calculus defined as an inductive type in Coq and we prove properties by structural induction over SL sequents.
%4. Explain, in one sentence, how you tackled the research question.
%We also present a generalized SL and metatheory statement, allowing us to prove many cases of such theorems in a general way and understand how to identify and prove the difficult cases.
%6. As a single sentence, what's the key impact of your research?
%We make a concrete and measurable improvement to Hybrid with the new SL formalization and provide a technique for abstracting such proofs, leading to a condensed presentation, greater understanding, and a generalization that may be instantiated to other logics.

% Preface:
%Hybrid is a logical framework that supports the use of higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) in representing formal systems or ``object logics'' (OLs). It is implemented in Coq and follows a two-level approach, where a specification logic (SL) is implemented as an inductive type and used to concisely and elegantly encode the inference rules of the formal systems of interest. In this thesis, we develop a new higher-order specification logic based on hereditary Harrop formulas for Hybrid. By increasing the expressive power of the SL beyond what was considered previously, we increase the flexibility of encoding OLs and thus extend the class of formal systems for which we can reason about efficiently. We focus on formalizing an important class of metatheorems for the SL. This class includes properties such as weakening, contraction, exchange, and the admissibility of the cut rule. The cut admissibility theorem establishes consistency and also provides justification for substituting a formula for an assumption in a context of assumptions. It can greatly simplify reasoning about OLs in systems that provide HOAS. The proofs of these theorems are discussed in detail, illustrating the challenges of their formalization. We develop an abstract way in which to present the specification logic and its metatheory and show how it can be used to prove the theorems mentioned above.

%Hybrid is a logical framework that supports the use of higher-order abstract syntax (HOAS) in representing formal systems or ``object logics'' (OLs). It is implemented in Coq and follows a two-level approach, where a specification logic (SL) is implemented as an inductive type and used to concisely and elegantly encode the inference rules of the formal systems of interest. In this paper, we develop a new higher-order specification logic for Hybrid. By increasing the expressive power of the SL beyond what was considered previously, we increase the flexibility of encoding OLs and thus extend the class of formal systems for which we can reason about efficiently. We focus on formalizing the meta-theory of the SL. We develop an abstract way in which to present an important class of meta-theorems. This class includes properties such as weakening, contraction, exchange, and the admissibility of the cut rule. The cut admissibility theorem establishes consistency and also provides justification for substituting a formula for an assumption in a context of assumptions. It can greatly simplify reasoning about OLs in systems that provide HOAS. We discuss the proof of this theorem in detail, illustrating the challenges of its formalization. We present the abstraction and show how it is used to prove all of these theorems.

Many symbols are used to denote values of different types. This allows us to impose some structure that is useful in understanding the work presented later, but is not actually built in to the system. We summarize the meta-variables used in the contributions chapters of this thesis. All symbols described here may also be seen with subscripts or the prime notation (i.e.$'$) when we need to talk about more than one term of a given type.

% We provide two methods to introduce your bibliography.
%
% The hand made bibliography:
% The basic method used the file biblio.tex.  It makes used of
% the standard LaTeX environment \begin{thebibliography}{} and
% \end{thebibliography}.
%
% The bibliography made with BibTeX:
% The second method used the file biblio.bib.  It makes used of
% BibTeX with the commands \bibliography{} and \bibliographystyle{}
% \bibliographystyle{} is defined in the preamble.
%
% For examples on how to use the command  \cite[]{} in the text
% to refer to items of the bibliography, look at the end of the
% section on the "Logistic Equation" in the source file
% qualitative.tex .  The results are dsiplayed at the end of
% Section 2.1 after compilation.
%
% Instead of \cite[]{}, one can use \citet[]{}  and  \citep[]{}.
% We have not illustrated how to use these commands but they are
% used like \cite[]{}.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Hand made bibliography
% \begin{BasicBibliography}
% \input{biblio.tex}
% \end{BasicBibliography}

% Default style for BibTeX
% The bibliography made with this command will include only references
% in the bib file which are cited in the text.
\bibTexBibliography{Thesis}

% The bibliography made with this command will include all references
% in the bib file even if they are not cited in the text.
% \bibTexBibliography*{biblio}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Finally, we print the index
%
% To mark item "name_of_the_item" for inclusion in the index, you have
% to insert the command \index{name_of_the_item} after you introduce
% the item for the first time in the text.
%
% If the item is part of the group "name_of_the_group", you may use
% the command \index{name_of_the_group!name_of_the_index}
% The item will then appear under the group name.
%
% If you don't want to have an index, comment out the following line
% and don't run makeindex template.idx .
